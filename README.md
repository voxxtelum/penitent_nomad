### Goal

`QUESTION` I want to know how many areas in the United States are within so many miles of different stores. For example: Which areas in the United States are within 100 miles of an IKEA and 30 miles of a Micro Center? What if I wanted areas also within 50 miles of Store C and 20 miles of Store D?

`STORES` The criteria I used for picking stores was first - if it was a store that I enjoyed visiting and second - stores with a relatively limited number of locations, since many larger retail chains are ubiquitous in most or all regions of the country.

`DATA` All store data was gathered by myself and was either scraped directly from their websites using python's `sracpy` package or found on an open API endpoint. Data was organized and cleaned using a combination of custom python/javascript scripts and Google Sheets.
